# Curses of Corpulence

## Quick description

You can now get cursed from different sources. These curses are a set of statistics which consist in giving you debuffs and some buffs, similarly to accessories, either permanently or temporarily.

## Why?

With this addon I was hoping to try and add some spice to the overall gameplay by adding some risks. As of now, the gameplay is pretty stramlined, and as you reach ""endgame"", dugeons and enemies tend to be easier to traverse and defeat. Adding curses seemed something fun to experiment with, leaving the player with some more than just loot.

## What's the difference and how does it work?

Accessories, are items which grant you different statistics boosts. You can choose these manually, allowing you to dynamically change your playstyle and preferences based on what you like most.

Curses on the other hand, are sets of effects which can vary the gameplay in different ways. You *can't* choose these manually, as these effects are inflicted on you by either enemies' attacks or kills. However, you'll be able to remove them thanks to an NPC, which can be found in the Hog Diner.
